## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Your IP Address

### On Kali Linux (VM):
```bash
ip a
```
#### Output:
```
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:7a:0c:fa brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.0.2.15/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scan Your Network for Devices
```bash
nmap -sP 10.0.2.15/24
```
#### Output:
```
Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.2
Host is up (0.00023s latency).
MAC Address: 52:55:0A:00:02:02 (Unknown)

Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.3
Host is up (0.00037s latency).
MAC Address: 52:55:0A:00:02:03 (Unknown)

Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.15
Host is up.
```

### Detected Devices:
- **10.0.2.2** ‚Äì Possible router or NAT gateway
- **10.0.2.3** ‚Äì Another device on the network
- **10.0.2.15** ‚Äì Kali Linux VM

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Open Ports on Your Machine
```bash
nmap -p 1-1000 10.0.2.15
```
#### Output:
```
Nmap scan report for 10.0.2.15
Host is up (0.0000060s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 10.0.2.15 are in ignored states.
Not shown: 1000 closed tcp ports (reset)
```
üîπ **Result:** No open ports detected on the scanned range (1-1000).

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting & Advanced Scanning

### üîç Scan All Ports (1-65535)
```bash
nmap -p- 10.0.2.15
```

### üîç Use SYN Scan (Stealthier, Requires Root)
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -p 1-1000 10.0.2.15
```

### üîç Check for Running Services
```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp
```
```bash
sudo ss -tulnp
```

### üîç Check Firewall Rules
```bash
sudo iptables -L
```
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Start a Service for Testing (Example: HTTP Server)
```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```
Then re-run:
```bash
nmap -p 80 10.0.2.15
```

## Conclusion
‚úÖ Successfully scanned the network and identified active devices. 
‚úÖ Found no open ports on the VM in the 1-1000 range.
‚úÖ Recommended additional scans to detect hidden services or firewall restrictions.
